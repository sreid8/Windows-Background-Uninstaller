This application is not finished.

Basically, it will search through the Windows Registry and get all the programs that can be uninstalled. It will make a list of applications that can be uninstalled automatically and a list of those that cannot be. The user will then select the applications he would like to uninstall. Those that can be automatically uninstalled will be, then the application will assist the user to get through the uninstallers that cannot be done automatically.

There are two Visual Studio Solutions in the repo. One is Uninstaller0.01 and this was written a few years ago when I was still in college. The code is unreadable and barely works. But I did like the idea and I'm not working on making good code in the Uninstaller directory. Eventually, the Uninstaller0.01 directory will be removed after all the functionality that I had originally written has been reimplemented in the new solution.
